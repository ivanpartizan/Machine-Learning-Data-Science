AI or artificial intelligence simply means a human intelligence exhibited by machines. 
AI is a machine that acts like a human. 
And currently in our industry we have something called narrow AI, that is machines can be just as good or even better than humans at specific tasks.

But each AI is only good at one task. 
Narrow AI that we currently have simply means those machines can only do one thing really well.
They can't be like humans and have multiple abilities.
That is called general AI and it's something that we are very far away from now.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and Machine Learning is an approach to try and achieve artificial intelligence through systems that can find patterns in a set of data.

Deep learning or deep neural networks is just one of the techniques for implementing Machine Learning.
For now, we can just think of it as a type of algorithm.

Data Science simply means analyzing data, looking at data and then doing something with it, usually some sort of a business goal.
So, when we talk about Machine Learning, there is a lot of overlap with Data Science.

The only reason that we care about Machine Learning is that we are able to use machines to predict results based on incoming data.

Machine Learning is using an algorithm or computer program to learn about different patterns in data and then taking that algorithm and what it learned to make predictions about the future using similar data.
ML algorithms are also called models.
Machine Learning algorithm looks at the input and then it looks at the output and it tries to figure out the set of instructions in between these two.
Machine models find patterns collected in data so we can use those patterns for future problems.

Data analysis is looking at a set of data and gaining an understanding of it by comparing different examples, different features and making visualizations like graphs. 
Data Science is running experiments on a set of data with the hopes of finding actionable insights within it.
One of these experiments may be to build a machine learning model.

We can consider Data Analysis and Machine Learning as a part of Data Science.

MACHINE LEARNING
lets computers make decisions about data 
and lets computers learn from data 
and then make predictions and decisions...

MACHINE LEARNING
is a general term for when computers learn from data, 
it allows computers to do tasks that in the past required humans. 

Machine learning comes in three parts -data collection, data modeling and deployment
We're going to cover data modeling, which means you'll be able to take a data set and apply machine
learning algorithms to find insights on that data

ML FRAMEWORK-six steps
1. Problem definition
What problem are we trying to solve? Supervised, unsupervised, classification, regression?
2. Data
What kind of data do we have?
Structured (rows and columns) or unstructured (like images or audio)?
3. Evaluation
What defines success for us?
4. Features
What features should we model? What do we already know about the data?
A machine learning algorithm's goal is to turn these features into patterns to make predictions.
5. Modelling
Based on our problem and data, what kind of ML model should we use?
6. Experimentation
How could we improve/what can we try next?

When shouldn't you use machine learning?
Will a simple hand-coded instruction based system work?

Main types of ML Problems:
SUPERVISED LEARNING
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
TRANSFER LEARNING
REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

SUPERVISED LEARNING - you have data and labels
a ML algorithm tries to use the data to predict a label
if it guesses the label wrong, the algorithm corrects itself and tries again
supervised learning algorithm repeats this process over and over again trying to get better

Main types of supervised learning:
Classification and regression

Classification: 
involves predicting if something is one thing or another
If there are only two options, it is called binary classification
If there are more than two options, it is called multi-class classification

Regression:
involves problems trying to predict the number
"how much will this house sell for?"
"how many people will buy this app?"

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - has data but no labels
you find patterns in the data and group customers (who purchase similar things together)
you provided the labels, they were not there to begin with but the patterns were
clusters - putting groups of similar examples together

TRANSFER LEARNING - leverages what one machine learning model has learned in another
machine learning model

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING - involves having a computer program performs some actions 
within a defined space and rewarding it for doing it well
or punishing it for doing poorly
example: teaching a ML algorithm to play chess

SUPERVISED LEARNING - 'I know my inputs and outputs'
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - 'I am not sure of the outputs but I have inputs'
TRANSFER LEARNING - 'I think my problem may be similar to something else'
